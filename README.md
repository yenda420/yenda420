### About Me

I'm a 20-year-old student passionate about any kind of development (mostly backend) and bringing ideas to life through code. My IT journey began at **SPSEI Ostrava**, where I focused on programming. I'm excited to continue my academic path at **FIT ÄŒVUT Prague** after the summer holidays, eager to dive deeper into computer science.

### My Interests & What I'm Learning

My primary focus and greatest interest lie in **backend programming**. I genuinely enjoy the process of **building robust and efficient systems** that power applications from behind the scenes.

I love working with **Java**, my favorite programming language, and I'm currently engaged in learning **Spring Boot** to create scalable web applications and APIs.

I'm also like to use **Artificial Intelligence** and enjoy finding ways to make it help me to build my projects.

### My Approach & Skills

I enjoy the challenge of **thinking through problems** and devising effective solutions. I'm a firm believer in **collaboration**, finding that working with others often leads to the best outcomes and insights.

You'll find some school assignments, personal coding exercises, and practical projects in my repositories. These reflect my hands-on approach and my coding progress over the time of my learning.

### Looking Ahead

I'm eager to explore diverse challenges within backend (or a different kind of) development and continuously expand my skill set. While I'm still discovering specific niches, I'm committed to building a strong foundation in core backend principles, modern technologies, and the exciting field of AI integration.
