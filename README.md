### About Me

I'm a 20-year-old student passionate about any kind of development (mostly backend) and bringing ideas to life through code. My IT journey began at **SPSEI Ostrava**, where I focused on programming. I'm excited to continue my academic path at **FIT ÄŒVUT Prague** after the summer holidays, eager to dive deeper into computer science.

### My Interests & What I'm Learning

My primary focus and greatest interest lie in **backend programming**. I genuinely enjoy the process of **building robust and efficient systems** that power applications from behind the scenes.

I love working with **Java**, my favorite programming language, and I'm currently engaged in learning **Spring Boot** to create scalable web applications and APIs.

I'm also like to use **Artificial Intelligence** and enjoy finding ways to make it help me to build my projects.
